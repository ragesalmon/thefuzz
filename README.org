* The Fuzz
The Fuzz is intended to be a simple fuzzy file search plugin which suppors helm. Development is ongoing

** Goals
 1) Have the ability to run from any directory with a single command
 2) Cache all files and subfolders of that directory
 3) Do so in a reasonably fast manner
 4) Cache folder results for a faster search experience upon subsequent uses
